## About the Stack
  This application was created based on two different infrastructures, Frontend and Backend.

### Backend

The `./backend` directory contains the Models, Database, Authentication, and API endpoints that make all of this functionality possible. To get the server up and running, simply click to the `./backend` folder and follow the README.md file to get started.

[View the README.md within ./backend for more details.](./backend/README.md)

### Frontend

The `./frontend` directory contains a complete Ionic frontend to consume the data from the Flask server. It's job is to provide user interface and interaction between the client and server. To get the frontend up and running, simply go to `./frontend` folder and follow the README.md file to get started.
